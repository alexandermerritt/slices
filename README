 CONTRIBUTORS
 
 This piece of software has been 'compiled' by Magic Magg (Magda Slawinska), 
 as part of the non-virtualized Keeneland standard software. 
 The software has been developed based on the software for the virtualized case
 Pegasus and Shadowfax for which credits go to:
 
 Vishakha Gupta
 Alex Merritt
 Abhishek Verma
 
Alex Merritt and Magda Slawinska ported the virtualized-based software to a
non-virtualized case. Magda's work targets supporting the actual deployment of
this codebase on large-scale GPU clusters, as well as the networking code.
Alex's work contributes to the assembly runtime, making it possible to map
applications across the cluster.
 
 
 DEPENDENCIES
 ===============
 
 * Scons - the build system
 
 * Installed CUDA Toolkit for
    - libcudart.a (or something)
    - some includes cuda_runtime_api.h, __cuda_format.h
    - nvcc compiler 
 
 BUILDING
 =============
 
 * unpack sources
 * run scons -Q (quiet - doesn't show scons information)

 # run with the debug compilation options enabled
 $ scons --set-debug-flags  
   
 # to run with the optimization compilation flag enabled
 $ scons --set-debug-flags  

 # run to see the options
 $ scons -h  
   
 * the default installation directory is 
 distro
 
 with:
  bin
  lib
  include
  
 * To clean the build
 scons -c
 
 * if you need to add another configuration go to the main
 SConstruct file and you need to override the variables
 in function set_build_variables()
 
KNOWN ISSUES
==============

* Right now it doesn't support CUDA 4.0 (you can have a newer driver, but
  the support is for CUDA Tookit 3.2 and SDK 3.2).

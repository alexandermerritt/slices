  1. clean up README - currently it is a total mess
  2. add kidron.ini as a file option
  - 2011-05-03, done
  add GLIB variable in the build system; right now it is hard coded
  
- 2011-04-12; 2011-05-02 done
  remove double INIPARSER from the build systems

    You need to update two SConstruct files:
    
    @todo this must be a smarter way to do that
    interposer/SConstruct
    backend/SConstruct
    

IMPLEMENTATION AND FEATURES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Legend
[ ]		not started
[L]		works, but some limitations (noted with feature)
[C]		complete

Items
[L]		implement libregistration
[ ]			multi-process (able to support multiple process reg without restart)
[ ]			multi-threading (?)
[ ]			multiple watches
[ ]			convert to self-contained library

[ ]		support multiple fat cubin binaries
[ ]		all hidden register calls need to be duplicated for across nodes in assm
[ ]		registered variables (the symbols) are assumed at the moment to be
		memory addresses; the runtime says they may also be strings: remove this
		assumption
			libci.c : cudaMemcpy[To|From]Symbol
			localsink.c : nv_exec_pkt

[L]		assembly interface
[ ]			assembly RPC (ability for node to be included in runtime)
[ ]			add monitoring data to assembly composition
[ ]			support notion of group membership for MPI codes

[ ]		networking interface

[ ]		scheduling interface

[ ]		support execution of CUDA apps on machines without GPUs? (all remote)

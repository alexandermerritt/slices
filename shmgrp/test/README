Run test_leader in one terminal.
Run test_member in another, passing arguments as specified by the help output
when executed without any arguments.

test_member will create multiple processes that each attempt to join the group
opened by test_leader. If you specify regions to create, each member will
additionally open/close that many number of regions, reading the first four
bytes in the region as a signed integer and printing out the value as hex.

----

To test the special (hidden) functions, run hacktest_leader in one terminal.
Run test_member in another, like before.

hacktest_leader will, instead of establish_member for each member that JOINs,
will instead fork/exec hacktest_child, passing the PID of the member as an
argument to that new process, upon which that child then uses the special
functions to create the state needed in the shmgrp library to establish new
members.

----

hacktest_child is not to be invoked by the user directly.
